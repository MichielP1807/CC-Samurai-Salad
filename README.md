A Fruit Ninja inspired game for ComputerCraft!
---

Samurai Salad, inspired by the mobile game *Fruit Ninja*, is a game where you slice various fruits (including pineapples) to gain points, but you have to avoid the bombs to stay alive.

- Having a large **combo** will give you more points per fruit
- **Difficulty** will increase over time: more bombs will spawn on average and things will spawn quicker
- Your **highscore** will be saved locally, see how high of a score you can get! (currently my highscore is 1293)

This game also has sound effects! To hear these sound effects in CraftOS-PC, you need to install the Minecraft sounds first, as seen [here](https://www.craftos-pc.cc/docs/periphemu).

### How to install
Download Samurai Salad from the [PineStore](https://pinestore.cc/projects/fun/5/samurai-salad)!

```
